# Numerical Computing (Spring 2016)

This repo contains implementations of some classic numerical algorithms as well
as some of my own code to solve similar problems.

If you are taking CS421 at NYU, be mindful that viewing or referencing
this code is likely in violation of the honor code that was specified by
your professor, so don't do it.
